For this next step, we made various improvements and advancements to our game. 
The physics components that we chose, specifically the doors, give the player a more interactive experience beyond just checking the temperatures of the workers. The doors also give the player a kind of distraction to make the game a bit more difficult. 
Throughout the map, the only doors that move are the ones that allow you to enter the restrooms. Behind the door, there is a “dummy” NPC performing a comedic animation. 
Again, displayed to distract the player. With the overall terrain design, the colored lights were to set the tone and theme of the office floor. 
Then the chosen textures create depth and a more visually stimulating experience. 
Growing from the visual aspect of our game, the animation and NPC AI algorithms placed within our game also elude more to the feel of the office environment. 
On top of the theme development, the “dummy” NPCs are also placed randomly throughout the game as distractions all together. 
However this differentiation is not voiced to the player at any time. 
Making it the players job to understand that some of the “workers” on the level do not count towards the total number of workers 
that need to be checked in order to win.
